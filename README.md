The OLA Data Analysis Dashboard is an interactive Power BI report that provides deep insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and revenue trends for OLAâ€™s ride-booking operations. The goal of this project is to leverage data visualization and analytics to support data-driven decision-making and identify key business growth opportunities.
This dashboard was designed to help stakeholders monitor KPIs such as total sales, number of rides, revenue, driver performance, and customer satisfaction over time.
